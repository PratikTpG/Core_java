      /* ----------------- Inheritance ----------------
         # code re-usability
         #process of accessing properties and methods of parent/bae/super class
                to child/derived/subclass is known as inheritance

         # Also known as IS-A relationship.
         # It's a generalization to specialization process.
         # We can inheritance does not support in java with class.
         # Multiple inheritance does not support in java with class vut it happens with interface.

         # We cant inherit private properties, methods and constructors.
         # 'extends' keywords is used in inheritance.
                   #Syntax :
                        child_class extends parent_class{
                        //properties : parent + child

                        //methods : parent + child
                        }
                        e.g
                        class A{

                        }

                        class B extends A{

                        }

                        class c extends B{
